# Changelog

The latest changes to the App UI Kit.

## 5.9.0 - 2026-05-20

### Changed

* The `Select` component's search input is now borderless in desktop mode and gains a shadow on scroll in sheet mode.
* The `Select` component's default popover width now adjusts to fit its content while ensuring it is at least as wide as the trigger element. The `stretch` prop no longer enforces a `40u` minimum width.
* Increased the max height of the `Select` popover menu to `260px`.
* Increased spacing in `SearchInputMenu` and `Menu` components when using an optional `MenuDivider`. This change may result in minor visual differences.
* Minor change to the `colorActionOverlayBgHovered`, `colorContentSubtlestFg`, and `colorControlBg` tokens for dark mode modernization.
* Upgraded `mobx` dependency to `6.15.1`.

### Fixed

* Fixed a visual bug affecting the positioning of nested `FlyoutMenu` components.
* Fixed an invalid `aria-label` on the `<span>` rendered by `CharacterCountDecorator`. The component now uses visually hidden components to announce `"{count} out of {max} characters used"` for screen readers, while hiding the `count/max` visual from assistive technologies via `aria-hidden`.

## 5.8.0 - 2026-04-30

### Changed

* The `Avatar` component now uses the WCAG 2.0 algorithm for selecting contrasting background colors, improving accessibility. Minor visual changes are expected for Avatars without photos.
* The `HtmlPreview` component now fills its container and scrolls natively, resolving ResizeObserver loops and double-scrollbar issues. To control dimensions, wrap it in a sized element.
* The background color of form input fields has been updated to use new color tokens. In dark mode, inputs will now appear darker. Minor visual changes are expected.
* The `Badge` component now allows the `ariaLabel` prop to be optional for circle badges. Previously, `ariaLabel` was required when `shape="circle"` to ensure accessibility. Consumers can now handle accessible labeling via parent elements instead.
* The `PillsInput` component now returns focus to the text input after all pills are removed or cleared, improving accessibility by maintaining the correct focus order.
* The `ProgressBar` component's default gradient fill colors have been adjusted to improve accessibility with better contrast ratios. Minor visual changes are expected.
* The `MenuDivider` component now has `role="none"` instead of the implicit `role="separator"`. This change addresses accessibility concerns and aligns with best practices for menu elements.

### Added

* Added `secondary` and `tertiary` variants for small-sized `Button` components with labels.

### Fixed

* Fixed the `Select` component emitting an `aria-controls` attribute that referenced the dropdown menu even when the menu was not mounted, which caused invalid accessibility references. `aria-controls` is now only set while the menu is open.

## 5.7.0 - 2026-03-05

### Changed

* The `Box` component's foreground color has been updated when the background is set to `canvas`, `tabdock`, `page`, `surface`, or `neutralLow`. There may be minor visual changes.
* The `Text` component's line height for size `large` has been adjusted from 26px to 24px to align proportionally with other sizes. Minor visual changes should affect whitespace only.
* `TestAppUiProvider` now supports an option to disable animations for testing purposes.
* The `SurfaceHeader` component now uses a larger size for the back icon, resulting in minor visual changes.

## 5.6.0 - 2026-02-19

### Changed

* Internal updates to css color token values, very minor visual regressions may appear.
* Updated the `colorUiOverlayBg` color token value to be slightly darker in dark mode.
* `Flyout` trigger has internal markup changes, removed an outer div wrapper from the `Flyout` component, no layout impact or regressions are expected.
* Flyout component internal behavior change, header content (title, description) now defaults to center alignment for mobile sheet view to align to the rest of Canva.
* Changes the line height of the `Title` component in size "large", from 32px to 30px on viewports \<600px, and 42px to 40px on larger viewports. Visual changes are minor and affect whitespace only.
* Updated internal `Title` font weights for most `Title` sizes, large/medium/small titles from 700 to 600. No change required for consumers of the Title component, minimal visual shifts are expected affecting horizontal whitespace only.
* Added better viewport safe-area detection to pinned elements, like the `Flyout` or `FlyoutMenu`.

### Added

* Added a `HtmlPreview` component that can be used to display HTML in the `previewUi` of content publisher intent apps.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where the `Text` component font weight would behave differently than expected when when using a 'b' or 'strong' tag. They will now be 600 weight like the usual `bold` variant of that component.
* Fixed an issue with the `Carousel` and `Tabs` components would render incorrectly not follow the global ltr / rtl directions.
* Fixed an issue where the `PillsInput` remove button isn't being triggered when `maxRows` is set and content is scrollable.

## 5.5.0 - 2026-01-14

### Changed

* Reverted `Checkbox` component to use `box-shadow` spread animation for checked/indeterminate states. The previous `background-color` workaround was for an [iOS 26.1 Beta WebKit bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=300477) that has since been fixed in the stable release. No code changes required - this is a visual implementation detail.
* Made the `Flyout` component popover and sheet appearances have the same DOM structure on first paint.
* Updated CSS tokens used in various components. Expect very slight visual updates.

### Fixed

* Fixed the `Slider` component briefly flashing with the fill bar at 100% when first loading.
* Fixed the `Card` component fixed focus outline not visible on Safari.
* Fixed carousel items not properly applying item width when they have fluid content.

* Updated `mobx` peer dependency requirement to `^6.13.5` from `^6.13.3`.
* Updated CSS tokens used in `AudioCard`, expect very slight visual updates.

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where the `Carousel` component would crash upon unmount.
* Fixed `onScroll` being called incorrectly in edge cases for the `Scrollable` component. It's now only called on scroll events.

## 5.3.0 - 2025-12-10

### Changed

* Updated `react` and `react-dom` peer dependencies to `^19.2.1`.
* `Carousel` component improvements:
  * Items that are not fully visible are now marked as `inert` by default. This means their elements and descendants won't be tabbable or interactive until they are fully visible. A new prop `outOfViewItemBehavior` has been added to opt out of this behavior.
  * Accessibility skip links have been disabled by default if the "inert" `outOfViewItemBehavior` is selected (or defaulted), otherwise become enabled if "none" behavior is selected.
  * Updated the scroll buttons to have smoother animations, and updated the buttons to have circle buttons.
  * Updated item visibility thresholds to improve stability and usability.
* Updated internal shadow colors, small variations in shadows can be expected.

### Added

* Introduced the `SurfaceHeader` component.
* Added a `trigger` prop to the `FlyoutMenu` component, enabling any React.ReactNode to be a FlyoutMenu trigger.
* Added a `variant` prop to the `LinkButton` component, supporting either `regular` (default) or `critical`.

### Fixed

* Fixed a focus abandonment issue occurring when a focused carousel item becomes inert as the container is scrolled with arrow keys.
* Fixed an issue in cards where card content was sometimes leaking outside the selection border.
* Fixed a bug that produced focus jumps when navigating carousels with items wider than the container.

## 5.2.1 - 2025-11-11

### Fixed

* Fixed `ColorSelector` component which stopped working in development mode, due to [a regression in React 19.2](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/34840).

### Changed

* Updated the README to reference canva.dev docs for design tokens.

### Fixed

  * The top edge of the `Sheet` component would change position when the virtual keyboard is open.
  * Regression affecting transition of full height `Sheet`s when virtual keyboard opens.

## 5.1.0 - 2025-10-14

### Changed

* Changed `react` and `react-dom` peer dependency versions to 19.2.0.

### Added

* Added `onPlay`, `onPause`, and `onEnded` callbacks to the `AudioCard` component.

### Fixed

* Fixed an [IOS 26.1 beta bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=300477), which broke the way the box-shadow was applied to `Checkbox` to cover the entire area. Replaced it with background color.
* Fixed a bug where one `AudioCard` component unmounting would stop all currently playing `AudioCard`s.
* Restored missing colorControlBorder token.
* Updated the colorControlBorderHovered semantic token to be correct in dark mode.

## 5.0.2 - 2025-10-08

### Added

* Added `elevationSurfaceFloatingBg` token for use as a background (surface) color. It is the preferred migration for the colorSurface token that was removed in v5.

### Fixed

## 5.0.1 - 2025-09-30

### Removed

* **Breaking:** Added React 19 as a peer dependency and dropped React 18 support.
* **Breaking:** Remove tone property from InputPill component
* **Breaking:** Removed the default `colorSurface` background color styling for the global `html` tag.
* **Breaking:** Removed the deprecated `title` prop in the `Link` component. Use `tooltipLabel` instead.

### Changed

* **Breaking:** Implemented new design token system. See [App UI Kit v4 to v5 Migration Guide](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/app-ui-kit-v5-migration/) for more information on upgrading.
* **Breaking:** The `source` parameter of the `onChange` callback for the `ColorSelector` component is now optional. The migration is to check for undefined values in the callback handler.
* **Breaking:** The default value for the `alignY` property of `Column` is now `stretch`. To continue using the old implicit behavior, set it to `start` explicitly.
* **Breaking:** Replaced `Pill` and `InputPill` `truncateText` prop with new `maxWidth` prop. The new prop better describes its functionality, and represents its size in a more explicit manner.
* **Breaking:** Changed the `size` property for the `Pill` component to be consistent with `Button` size variants. To retain the old "small" Pill size, use the new "xsmall" variant.
* **Breaking:** `Pill` now uses a round shape to match Canva styling.

### Added

* Introduced a `wrapInset` prop for the `Badge` component, with a `-1u` value to improve the appearance and spacing of badges wrapped around icons.

  ```tsx
  <Box padding="3u">
    <Badge shape="circle" text="4" tone="assist" wrapInset="-1u">
      <CogIcon />
    </Badge>
  </Box>
  ```

### Fixed

* Other minor fixes and improvements.

**Note:** Canva's app submission process requires a single app bundle. Implementing localization might increase the size of the app and cause webpack to split the bundle into multiple chunks. If this happens, you can force webpack to emmit a single bundle [using the LimitChunkCountPlugin](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/localization/migrate-an-existing-app/#step-4-configure-webpack-chunk-limit):

In your `webpack.config.js`:

1. Add the `optimize` module to the `webpack` import:

```diff
- const { DefinePlugin } = require("webpack");
+ const { DefinePlugin, optimize } = require("webpack");
```

2. In the `plugins` add the chunk limit before buildDevConfig is called. Modify the plugins definition:

```diff
plugins: [
  new DefinePlugin({
    BACKEND_HOST: JSON.stringify(backendHost),
  }),
+ new optimize.LimitChunkCountPlugin({ maxChunks: 1 }),
],
```

## 2.0.0 - 2023-09-14

### Removed

* **Breaking:** Removed default reset styles, including `* { margin: 0 }`. Apps may need to update to add these styles back in to maintain current styling:

```
* {
    margin: 0;
}
img, picture, video, canvas, svg {
    display: block;
    max-width: 100%;
}
input, button, textarea, select {
    font: inherit;
}
```

* **Breaking:** Removed `disableBubbles` prop from `ProgressBar` component. The bubble effect is now always enabled.
  Any usages of the `disableBubbles` prop will need to be removed.

### Changed

* **Breaking:** Renamed background color tokens. All usages must be updated to use the new name.

The `Box` component's `background` prop has changed and should be renamed accordingly:

| before                   | after                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `<Box background={1} />` | `<Box background="canvas" />`  |
| `<Box background={2} />` | `<Box background="tabdock" />` |
| `<Box background={3} />` | `<Box background="page" />`    |
| `<Box background={4} />` | `<Box background="surface" />` |

Any references to the following color tokens should be renamed accordingly:

| before                  | after               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| tokens.colorBackground1 | tokens.colorCanvas  |
| tokens.colorBackground2 | tokens.colorTabdock |
| tokens.colorBackground3 | tokens.colorPage    |
| tokens.colorBackground4 | tokens.colorSurface |

Any references to the following CSS variables should be renamed accordingly:

| before                      | after                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| --ui-kit-color-background-1 | --ui-kit-color-canvas  |
| --ui-kit-color-background-2 | --ui-kit-color-tabdock |
| --ui-kit-color-background-3 | --ui-kit-color-page    |
| --ui-kit-color-background-4 | --ui-kit-color-surface |
